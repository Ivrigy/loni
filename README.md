### LONI - Single Parents All-in-One Platform

LONI is website for an early stage pre seed Startup. It is a brief introduction into what is going to become a one-stop social network directed at addressing life of a single parents that come in all colours, shapes and social roles. The website provides few resources,  insights and the direct access to waitlist.

### Scope
The scope of this project (PP1) was to deliver MVP of a website coded exclusively with HTML and CSS. I decided to do a basic structure that  was viable according to my capabilities and 3 weeks knowledge. Due to the prolonged sickness that affected partially skipped lessons, my main methodology was learning by doing. Something as if you would walk from Berlin to Vienna by foot. I spend too many hours awake and drank too many red bulls with the hope that this situation is not a definition of a Developer. Lastly, industrial era is so Passé and in XXI century we should prioritise mental and physical health. 

### Product Design

As i already know my potential Users /  Comrades I jumped straight into User stories. Here are some example:
* As a visitor, I want to quickly understand the purpose of the website so that I can decide whether or not to join the waitlist.
* As a visitor, I want the homepage be trustful  so that I feel confident providing my email to join the waitlist.
* As a single parent in need of help, I want easy access to a list of emergency contact numbers so that I can get immediate support during a crisis.
* As a single parent, I want to read real-life stories from other single parents so that I feel inspired and understood.
* As a visitor, I want a simple form to enter my email for the waitlist so that I can stay informed about the platform’s launch and updates.
* As a visitor, I want a confirmation message after submitting my email so that I know I successfully joined the waitlist.

When it comes to UI Design I again aimed on basics according to scope and time limitation. Colours are gender and social status neural aiming for diversity and accessibility. As my coding capabilities grow so will design follow.

### Features

The gartest hamartia of this website is a Homepage where I intentionally went against autoplay  and choose to prioritise empathy over rule. The beautiful kid in movement provides a warm welcoming  and accompanies hero message . I actually did a user test with two people (yes it is small number) and they said they preferred autoplay. 

For the logo I did not have time for a graphic interpretation, but instead I went for a Font  distinction that I incorporated across website. This Font style gives a playful childish look to the generally cooled website because single is parent  to a child - and not only semantically.

Footer is not my proudest work but it has all the necessary information. One of the biggest challenges I had was keeping footer at the end of the page independently from the heat of the content. I still do not quite understand it but I hope it will come soon.

Page get help serves as emergency  solution, a quick fix for parents (and design) and it substitutes the help that LONI will provide as platform once developed. In this section there is still work to be done, especially on the functionality of a dropdown menu. The plan is not only to fix it stylistically but also to provide change of content according to the country of residence. In the case shown it is only free emergency resources from Germany.

There were many moments during this project where I realised that the gap between design and development (especially if u are baby coder) can be huge. Card design is just one of few where I could not fully accomplish what I imagined . But, this basic solution serves a role of a blog stories.

Lastly, the form or about page should aim for Users to join the waitlist and get informed about progress of the digital platform LONI. I had to change a design as footer was moving up and also I did not quite succeeded in flexbox, so the solution I am not really happy about. In addition I put two pages, one as a thnx note for signing and one as a potential quantitative research  on single parents (still in progress).
